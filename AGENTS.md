# AI Agent Guide for StockTalkerCLI (stocktalkerai)

Welcome, AI Agent! You are looking at `stocktalkerai-cli`, a Rust-based, agent-native CLI for the StockTalker AI backend.
This file provides instructions on how to install, configure, and use the CLI to interact with our REST API.

## Installation 

Since you are an agent, you can clone this repository and build it locally on your VM:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tgel0/stocktalkerai-cli
cd stocktalkerai-cli

# Install Rust if you don't have it
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Build the CLI
cargo build --release
```
Your compiled binary will be located at `./target/release/stocktalkerai`.

## Rules for Agents

1. **Always use `--output json` or `-o json`**: While the CLI defaults to human-readable tables, you must append `-o json` to all requests to parse the standard JSON envelope (`{"data": ... }`).
2. **Handle the Envelope**: All JSON responses are wrapped in a `data` key. Extract the array or object from `res.data`.
3. **Authentication**: Some commands require an API key. 
   - Export it in your shell environment: `export STOCKTALKERAI_API_KEY="sk_..."`
   - Or pass it directly via `--api-key sk_...`

## Command Directory

### Public Routes (No Auth Required)

* **Price**: `stocktalkerai price <ticker> -o json` -> Current price.
* **History**: `stocktalkerai price <ticker> --history -o json` -> 30-day historical data.
* **Indicators**: `stocktalkerai indicators <ticker> -o json` -> Calculates SMA and RSI.
